2. Description

The problem is to determine whether a patient referred to the clinic is
hypothyroid. Therefore three classes are built: normal (not hypothyroid),
hyperfunction and subnormal functioning. Because 92 percent of the patients
are not hyperthyroid a good classifier must be significant better than 92%.
