# A restricted SVD based CUR decomposition for matrix triplets

The code rsvd_cur_deim.m is a matlab implementation of a RSVD-CUR decomposition algorithm based on discrete empirical interpolation method. For more information about how this algorithm works please see https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02113

## Data sets
mfeat-fou, mfeat-kar, and mfeat-pix are the data sets used in Exp 4.3 
ann-train.data and ann-test.data are the data sets used in Exp 4.4
